# 🚖 IshanCabs: End-to-End (E2E) Architecture Document

This document provides a comprehensive end-to-end technical overview of the **IshanCabs Web Application** architecture. It describes the client-first serverless structure, outlines user interaction sequence flows for different modules, documents database schemas, and models document relationships.

---

## 1. 🌐 High-Level System Architecture

IshanCabs is built on a **Serverless, Client-First Architecture**. The application does not require a custom backend application server; instead, the browser executes the core application logic and establishes secure, direct connections to cloud services and third-party APIs.

## 2. 🔄 Module Interaction Flows (Stick / Sequence Diagrams)

These sequence diagrams depict step-by-step system interactions across different modules.

### A. Rider Authentication & Session Initialization
This flow manages secure access checks during client load, separating standard riders from dashboard administrators.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Rider as Rider / User
    participant Browser as Web Browser (app.js)
    participant FBAuth as Firebase Auth
    participant Firestore as Firestore (/users)
    actor Admin as Administrator

    Rider->>Browser: Loads landing page (index.html)
    Browser->>FBAuth: Check current authentication state (onAuthStateChanged)
    
    alt User is Logged In
        FBAuth-->>Browser: Returns user object (UID, Email)
        Browser->>Firestore: Queries user profile details by UID
        Firestore-->>Browser: Returns user document (role)
        
        alt User Role is "admin"
            Browser->>Browser: Hides Booking buttons & reveals "Admin Panel" CTA
            Admin->>Browser: Clicks "Admin Panel"
            Browser->>Browser: Redirects to modules/admin/admin.html
        else User Role is "rider"
            Browser->>Browser: Reveals "Book Cab" & "Activity" CTA buttons
        end
    else User is Guest (Logged Out)
        Browser->>Browser: Directs user to authenticate if they click Book Cab
    end
```

### B. Customer Booking & Custom Location Map Flow
This flow represents the 3-step customer checkout loop. It coordinates Leaflet mapping, Nominatim searching, OSRM route calculations, overbooking checks, promo verification, and database logging.

    Firestore-->>Engine: Returns active rates (base, rate_per_km, rate_per_hour)
    Engine->>Engine: Compiles estimated fares per vehicle tier
    
    Engine->>Firestore: Check overbookings (compares active booking counts vs. vehicle roster size)
    Firestore-->>Engine: Returns capacity states
    
    alt Fleet Tier is Sold Out
        Engine-->>Page: Displays "Sold Out" state and locks tier card selection
    else Fleet Tier is Available
        Engine-->>Page: Displays calculated fares for Sedan, SUV, and MUV cards
    end

    Rider->>Page: Selects class card & advances to Review (Step 3)
    
    opt Enters Promo Discount Code
        Controller->>Firestore: Query coupon details from /offers collection
        Firestore-->>Controller: Returns status, minimum threshold, and discount value

    Engine-->>Page: Triggers success banner
    Page-->>Rider: Shows success screen & schedules auto-redirect to home
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Admin as Fleet Administrator
    participant Panel as Admin Panel (admin.html)
    participant Logic as Admin Controller (adminUI.js)
    participant Firestore as Cloud Firestore

    Note over Logic: Snapshot listeners are active for bookings, vehicles, and drivers
    Firestore-->>Logic: Stream database updates dynamically
    Logic->>Panel: Populate list tables and update dashboard KPI metrics counters

    Admin->>Panel: Accesses "Requested" booking list & clicks "Accept Ride"
    Logic->>Logic: Calls loadFleetRoster()
    Note over Logic: Roster entries = active drivers associated with active vehicles
    
    Logic->>Firestore: Query existing bookings where status is "confirmed" or "active"
    Firestore-->>Logic: Returns busy driver phones & vehicle license plates
    
    Logic->>Panel: Populate Dropdown Roster grouped by Tier

    Admin->>Panel: Selects dynamic driver-car option (or fills manual text overrides)
    
    opt Choice has "[Busy - On Ride]" Tag
        Logic->>Panel: Renders inline warning notification on screen
    end
    
    Admin->>Panel: Adjusts manual override discount (optional) & clicks "Confirm Allocation"
    
    Logic->>Logic: Executes double-booking conflict verification
    
    alt Selected Roster Entry is Confirmed/Active on another ride

    else Selected Roster Entry is Free
        Logic->>Firestore: Updates /bookings/{id} (status: "confirmed", driver_assignment: {...})
        Firestore-->>Logic: Record updated successfully
        Logic->>Panel: Closes modal and updates lists in real-time
    end
```

### D. Driver & Vehicle Registry Association Flow
This details the bidirectional reference mapping mechanism when updating or registering operators.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Admin as Fleet Administrator
    participant Panel as Admin Panel
    participant Logic as Admin Controller (adminUI.js)
    participant Firestore as Cloud Firestore

    Admin->>Panel: Fills Vehicle Form (Plate: WB02A1111) & assigns Driver (Phone: 918981538038)
    Admin->>Panel: Clicks "Save Vehicle"
    Logic->>Firestore: Writes vehicle document (doc_id: "WB02A1111", assigned_driver_id: "918981538038")
    
    opt Vehicle was previously linked to another driver
        Logic->>Firestore: Updates previous driver document setting assigned_vehicle_id: null
    end
    
    Logic->>Firestore: Updates assigned driver document setting assigned_vehicle_id: "WB02A1111"
    
    opt Driver was previously linked to another vehicle
        Logic->>Firestore: Updates previous vehicle document setting assigned_driver_id: null
    end
    
    Firestore-->>Logic: Write operations complete
